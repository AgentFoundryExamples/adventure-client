# Environment Variables Template for Adventure Client
# 
# This file serves as a template showing all required environment variables.
# DO NOT put real values here - this file is committed to version control.
#
# ============================================================================
# QUICK START GUIDE
# ============================================================================
#
# For local development:
#   1. Copy .env.development to .env.local:
#      cp .env.development .env.local
#   
#   2. Update .env.local with your actual Firebase configuration
#      (Get values from Firebase Console > Project Settings > Your apps)
#   
#   3. .env.local is in .gitignore and will not be committed
#   
#   4. Start dev server:
#      npm run dev
#
# For production deployment:
#   - Pass values as Docker build arguments during docker build
#   - Example:
#     docker build \
#       --build-arg VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-key \
#       --build-arg VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project \
#       ... (all other variables)
#   - Or store in GitHub Secrets / Google Secret Manager for CI/CD
#   - See docs/cloud-run-deploy.md for complete deployment guide
#
# ============================================================================
# IMPORTANT: VITE BUILD-TIME VARIABLES
# ============================================================================
#
# All VITE_* variables are BAKED INTO THE JAVASCRIPT BUNDLE at build time:
#   ✅ Variables are read during `npm run build` and embedded in static assets
#   ⚠️ Changing variables requires rebuilding and redeploying the application
#   ⚠️ All VITE_* variables are visible in client bundle (never store secrets)
#   ❌ Cloud Run runtime env vars (--set-env-vars) DO NOT work for VITE_*
#
# See README.md "Configuration" section for comprehensive explanation.
#
# ============================================================================
# CONFIGURATION CONTRACT
# ============================================================================
#
# All variables below are consumed by src/config/env.ts
# The application will fail fast at startup if required variables are missing
# See src/config/env.ts for validation logic and type definitions
#
# ============================================================================

# ============================================================================
# API Base URLs
# ============================================================================
# Backend API endpoints for the Adventure Game services.
# These URLs determine where the frontend sends API requests.
#
# The application uses two separate backend services:
# - Dungeon Master API: Core game logic, turn processing, game state
# - Journey Log API: Character management, narrative tracking, history
#
# Both services must be accessible from the client's network environment.
#
# REQUIRED: Both URLs must be set (application will fail at startup if missing)
# IMPORTANT: Production URLs MUST use HTTPS protocol (not HTTP)
# WARNING: Do NOT use localhost URLs in production builds

# Dungeon Master API - Handles game orchestration and turn processing
# Local Development: http://localhost:8001
# Staging:           https://dungeon-master-staging-xxx.run.app
# Production:        https://dungeon-master-xxx.run.app
VITE_DUNGEON_MASTER_API_BASE_URL=

# Journey Log API - Handles character management and narrative tracking
# Local Development: http://localhost:8002
# Staging:           https://journey-log-staging-xxx.run.app
# Production:        https://journey-log-xxx.run.app

# ============================================================================
# Firebase Configuration
# ============================================================================
# Get these values from Firebase Console > Project Settings > General > Your apps
# See docs/firebase-setup.md for detailed instructions on obtaining these values
#
# REQUIRED VARIABLES: API Key, Auth Domain, Project ID, Storage Bucket,
#                     Messaging Sender ID, App ID
# OPTIONAL VARIABLES: Measurement ID (only if using Google Analytics)
#
# IMPORTANT: Use separate Firebase projects for different environments:
# - Development: For local testing and development
# - Staging: For QA and pre-production testing
# - Production: For live users
#
# SECURITY NOTES:
# - Firebase API keys are safe to expose in client code - access control is
#   managed by Firebase Security Rules, not by hiding the API key
# - Backend secrets (service account keys, database passwords) should NEVER
#   be stored in VITE_* variables as they are visible in the client bundle
# - Use separate Firebase projects to isolate environments

# Firebase API Key (required)
# Location: Firebase Console > Project Settings > General > Web apps > Config
# Note: This is safe to expose in client code - access is controlled by Firebase Security Rules
# Example: AIzaSyXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=

# Firebase Auth Domain (required)
# Format: your-project-id.firebaseapp.com
# This domain is used for Firebase Authentication redirects and OAuth flows
# CRITICAL: Add your Cloud Run domain to Firebase Authorized Domains before production
# Example: adventure-game-dev.firebaseapp.com
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=

# Firebase Project ID (required)
# Your Firebase project identifier (NOT the project display name)
# Used to identify which Firebase project to connect to
# IMPORTANT: Use different project IDs for dev/staging/production
# Example: adventure-game-dev
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=

# Firebase Storage Bucket (required)
# Format: your-project-id.appspot.com
# Required by Firebase SDK even if not actively using Cloud Storage
# Example: adventure-game-dev.appspot.com
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=

# Firebase Messaging Sender ID (required)
# Required by Firebase SDK even if not using push notifications
# Example: 123456789012
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=

# Firebase App ID (required)
# Format: 1:123456789012:web:abc123def456
# Unique identifier for your Firebase web app registration
# Example: 1:123456789012:web:abcdef1234567890
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=

# Firebase Measurement ID (optional)
# Format: G-XXXXXXXXXX
# Required only if using Google Analytics with Firebase
# If not set, defaults to empty string (application will still work)
# Example: G-ABC1234567
VITE_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=

# ============================================================================
# Environment-Specific Configuration Examples
# ============================================================================
#
# LOCAL DEVELOPMENT:
# Use localhost URLs for both APIs and a test Firebase project
# VITE_DUNGEON_MASTER_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8001
# VITE_JOURNEY_LOG_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8002
# VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=adventure-game-dev
#
# STAGING:
# Use Cloud Run URLs for staging APIs and staging Firebase project
# VITE_DUNGEON_MASTER_API_BASE_URL=https://dungeon-master-staging-xyz.run.app
# VITE_JOURNEY_LOG_API_BASE_URL=https://journey-log-staging-xyz.run.app
# VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=adventure-game-staging
#
# PRODUCTION:
# Use production Cloud Run URLs and production Firebase project
# VITE_DUNGEON_MASTER_API_BASE_URL=https://dungeon-master-prod-xyz.run.app
# VITE_JOURNEY_LOG_API_BASE_URL=https://journey-log-prod-xyz.run.app
# VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=adventure-game-prod
#
# ============================================================================
# Troubleshooting
# ============================================================================
#
# Issue: "Firebase configuration is incomplete" error
# Solution: Ensure all required variables (marked required above) are set
#
# Issue: Environment variables not updating
# Solution: Restart dev server (environment variables are loaded at startup)
#
# Issue: API requests fail with network errors
# Solution: Verify backend services are running at the specified URLs
#
# Issue: 401 Unauthorized errors
# Solution: Ensure Firebase project matches the backend's expected project
#
